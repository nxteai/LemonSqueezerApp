# LemonSqueezerApp

LemonSqueezerApp is an interactive app where users can go through a fun process of harvesting lemons, squeezing them, making lemonade, and then restarting the process. The app uses Android's Jetpack Compose for building modern UIs and follows the best practices for mobile development.

## Features
- **Step-by-step interaction**: Users progress through the app by tapping on images, such as tapping on a lemon tree, squeezing a lemon, and drinking lemonade.
- **Randomized lemon squeezing**: The number of taps needed to squeeze a lemon is randomized between 2 and 4.
- **Smooth user interface**: The app uses Jetpack Compose for a modern UI and ensures a smooth, responsive experience.
